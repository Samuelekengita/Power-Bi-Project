### Findings and results

The analysis results are summarized as follows:

1. The company has a total of 1.470 employees
2. The company has a total of 882 males who make up 60% of the staff strenght.
3. The company has a total of 558 female staffs which make up 40% of the staff strenght.
4. Recommendations were for the staffs that should be retrenched and those due for promotion
